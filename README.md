# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Assignment
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Run the project
1. Download and unpack the project data via
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Download ```run_analysis.R``` from GitHub and put it in the same folder as ```UCI HAR Dataset``` 
and make this your working directory 
3. Run ```run_analysis.R``` and you'll get an output document called ```tiny_data.txt```
